This code demonstrates common arithmetic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide) in JavaScript, including robust error handling for division by zero.  The solution focuses on best practices for handling potential runtime errors.  The `try...catch` block ensures that the program doesn't crash if an invalid operation (division by zero) is attempted. This example is suitable for understanding basic arithmetic functions and exception handling in JavaScript.
